            To create, edit, delete, schedule, or execute a data set import, go to <i>Admin->Data Set Imports</i>. Ada currently provides six data import adapters,
            three file-based: CSV, JSON, and tranSMART; and three RESTful-based: REDCap, Synapse, and eGAIT.
        </p>

        <p>
            To create a new data set import, select a desired type in a drop down <img src="@routes.CustomDirAssets.versioned("images/documentation/new_dropdown_button.png")"/> located on the right side.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is a data set import similar to the one you want to create, click <img src="@routes.CustomDirAssets.versioned("images/documentation/copy_button.png")"/> located on the right side
            and select the source import you want to copy in an autocomplete textbox. Then edit it accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            To execute a data set import click <img src="@routes.CustomDirAssets.versioned("images/documentation/run_data_set_import_button.png")"/> at the associated row in a table. Note that you do not need to wait for the import to fully proceed and you can continue working at different sections of Ada
            since depending on the data set size a data set import might take several seconds to minutes to finish.

            Ada allows users to conveniently explore and filter data, and calculate various statistics with embedded interactive visualizations,

            This makes Ada an ideal tool for a collaborative reporting.
