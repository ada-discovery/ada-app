            Ada has a modular, lightweight, layered architecture, centered around <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> stack, with a strong focus on performance.
            Scala is a modern functional and object-oriented JVM language developed by academics at <a href="https://www.epfl.ch">EPFL</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main libraries include <a href="https://www.playframework.com">Play Framework</a> for web, <a href="http://spark.apache.org">Spark</a> for distributed computing and machine learning, and <a href="https://akka.io/">Akka</a> for streaming.
            Ada persists data in two popular NoSQL databases, Elastic Search and Mongo, which provide flexible, schema-free JSON storage. As a matter of fact, JSON in Ada is prominently used coast-to-coast.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ada is packed and compiled using Play sbt scripts as a standalone application with an embedded Netty server, which can be deployed anywhere.
