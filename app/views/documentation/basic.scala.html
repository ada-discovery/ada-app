            Imported data are organized hierarchically as a tree, which is located on the left side and is used for navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three types of nodes:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Leaf nodes</b> represent data sets.</li>
                <li><b>Inner nodes</b> are data spaces, which serve as data set folders.</li>
                <li><b>Top-level nodes</b> are called studies.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, it is not recommended a single data set can reside at several locations in the tree.
        </p>

    @section(Some("section_data_exploration"), Some("Data Exploration"), 1) {
        <p>
            Each data set contains any number of <it>views</it>. View is a container of different filters, widgets, and tables.
            Main view (usually called "Main") is invoked by default when a data set is selected in the navigation tree.
        </p>
        <p>
            Graphical widgets, which represent the outcome of certain statistics (such as distribution or correlation) can be of 5 chart types: pie, column, bar, line, and polar.
            The chart type of a widget can be dynamically changed by clicking  <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/documentation/chart_type_change_button.png")"/> in the top left corner of the widget,
            and choosing a new type. The chart will redrawn immediately after the selection.
        </p>
        <p>
            Views are not static; they can be dynamically filtered. The easiest way to filter is to click on a desired category in a distribution widget (e.g., "Female").

            Since one of the main functionalities of Ada is to provide comprehensive reports, which can be later included in other documents or post-processed, Ada provides several options for exporting.
        </p>
        <p>
            More specifically, each (graphical) widget can be exported into four formats: PNG, JPEG, PDF, and SVG.
            This can be achieved by clicking either <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/documentation/chart_export_button.png")"/> in the top right corner of a specific widget,
            or by selecting "Export charts as ..." in the Export menu located in the top right corner of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides the chart exports, data can be exported to CSV, JSON, or tranSMART file format, available in the Export menu.
            These include the following options:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Export All as CSV/JSON</b> - As the name suggest, it exports the entire data set with all the rows and fields.</li>
                <li><b>Export Filtered as CSV/JSON</b> - This selection exports only the filtered rows/items with all the fields.</li>
                <li><b>Export Filtered Table as CSV/JSON</b> - This is the most conservative but probably the most preferred option. It exports only the filtered rows/items with the fields/columns from the view's table (located at the bottom).</li>
                <li><b>Export as TranSMART Data</b> - It exports all the rows to the tranSMART data file format. It includes only the fields that are linked to a category.</li>
                <li><b>Export as TranSMART Mapping</b> - It exports all the fields with a category (i.e., without data) to the tranSMART mapping file format.</li>
            </ul>
            For a CSV export, users can specify a delimiter (default ","), end-of-line String (default "\n"), and a replacement of the eol characters with white space (default yes).
            A custom delimiter can be also entered for a TranSMART export.
