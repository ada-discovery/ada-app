            <b>Ada</b>
            is a performant and highly configurable system for secured integration, visualization, and collaborative analysis of heterogeneous data sets, primarily targeting clinical and experimental sources.
        </div>

        The name Ada refers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a>, a British mathematician, and a coinventor of the Analytical Engine, the first model of a computer (together with Charles Babbage).

        <p>
            Ada allows users to conveniently explore and filter data, and calculate various statistics with embedded interactive visualizations,
            for instance, categorical and numerical distributions, scatters, correlations, and box plots.
        </p>

        <p>
            Moreover, one of Ada's main functionalities is to produce dynamic and personalized <it>views</it>
            containing filters, statistical widgets, and tables, which can be saved and shared among the users.
            This makes Ada an ideal tool for a collaborative reporting.

        <p>
            Ada has been originally developed for <a href="http://parkinson.lu">NCER-PD project</a>, for which it manages anonymized clinical data,
            biosample meta information provided by <a href="http://www.ibbl.lu">IBBL</a>, and
            kinetic data from <a href="http://parkinsonmpower.org">mPower mobile application</a>
            and <a href="http://www.egait.de">eGAIT shoe sensors</a>.
        </p>


        <p>
            Besides NCER-PD, the main instance of Ada currently harbours around 1300 data sets from diverse studies including <a href="http://www.denopa.de">DeNoPa</a>, <a href="http://www.ppmi-info.org">PPMI</a>, TREND, GBA, ADNI, and mPower.
            Furthermore, Ada facilitates robust access control through LDAP authentication, and in-house user management with fine-grained permissions.
            With a convenient user management UI, admins can simply specify which data sets are a user allowed to access and which actions on the data set he/she is allowed to perform.

        <p>
            To define data setâ€™s metadata Ada provides an editable dictionary, and a categorical tree with drag-and-drop manipulation.
            Ada supports many data field types including number, date, boolean, enumeration, and json. These (collectively called <it>dictionary</it>) could be automatically inferred during an import.
            Further, each field type can be either scalar or array, which makes Ada's type system flexible enough to cover a wide range of data origins and flavors.
        </p>

    @imageSection(Some("section_import"), Some("Import/Export"), Some("images/carousel/in-out2.gif")) {
        <p>
            The data set import adapters currently support three file formats:
            CSV, JSON, and tranSMART data and mapping files, and three secured RESTful APIs:
            <a href="https://www.project-redcap.org">REDCap</a>,
            <a href="https://www.synapse.org">Synapse</a>, and eGait.
        </p>

        <p>
            Any data sets provided from these sources can be added to (or removed from) Ada on-the-fly as well as scheduled for periodic execution.
            As such, Ada has potential to serve many translational medicine or any data exploration endeavors.
            For post-processing, filtered data can be exported into CSV, JSON, or tranSMART format.
        </p>

        <p>
            For more advanced analysis, well-grounded machine learning and statistical approaches were integrated using Spark ML library.
            This covers a wide variety of classification, regression, clusterization, feature selection, normalization, and time-series processing routines.
