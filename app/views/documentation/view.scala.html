            View is a central presentation concept is Ada. It is a customizable container of different filters, widgets, and tables.
            To create a new view go to <i>Setting->Views</i> and click on <img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/documentation/new_button.png")"/> located on the right side.
            Once a view is created, widgets from analytical sections can be added to the view by clicking <code>+To</code> in their screens.
            Size and position of each widget is customizable through the options, such as width (in columns: max 12), height (in pixels), and offset.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before you create a new filter or view, always verify if the same (or similar) view does not exist.
            Always give a filter or a view a appropriate name reflecting its meaning and use, such as "Cases vs Controls (Motor Tests)" and avoid dummy names, e.g., "View 21” and "Peter’s Stuff".
            Do not include too many widgets and table columns in a single view; split if necessary.
            Note that views can be copied (<img src="@routes.Assets.versioned("images/documentation/copy_button.png")"/>) so if there is a view you like do not start from scratch and copy and modify the view instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            Access rules for views (and filters) are quite straightforward: all non-private filters and views can be used by all the users who have access to the underlying data set.
            Filter or view can be edited or deleted only by the original creator (or admin).
