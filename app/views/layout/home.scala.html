                  The Data and Computing Platform provides key infrastructure for the integration, curation and interrogation of anonymized clinical and experimental data. The platform manages multidimensional data associated with clinical research, including patient data, sample-associated information, and high-throughput molecular readouts from these samples. These different data flows are integrated at their source with the help of advanced data capture and transfer approaches. Clinical data can be entered remotely, via electronic forms at the time of collection, assuring their integrity and standardization. To attain this goal, REDCap1, a state-of-the-art clinical research data management system has been implemented. All entered data will be immediately anonymized and sample-associated data will be accessed directly at their storage location, the IBBL, via secure communication with the LIMS of the biobank. High-throughput experimental data will be uploaded directly to the database service provided by LCSB for handling large, heterogeneous biomedical datasets: the tranSMART system2. tranSMART enables sharing, integration, standardization and analysis of heterogeneous data from collaborative translational research. It is used in pharmaceutical industry and in Innovative Medicine Initiative projects (e.g. eTRIKS3, AETIONOMY4) to store and share curated phenotypic data such as clinical observations and adverse events; omics data like transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and genotyping. Well-grounded machine learning and computational modeling approaches will enable data analysis and interpretation.
